0.041
- Tell user what we are doing when analyzing the current state

0.040
- Speedups/Caching (in memory)
- New storage format (uses less disk space; melts down ~13MB to 60kb per state) 
- Converter which converts old states (version >=0.027) to the new format
- Overall performance: up to 5 times faster than 0.035
- Do not call GetTerminalSize() from Term::ReadKey when --postsync is called.
  (Problems occured while testing on ppc/efika. Reported by Wernfried Haas <amne@gentoo.org>)
- Moved configfile to /etc/demerge.conf (converter takes care about moving your configfile to the new location)

0.035

0.033
- This release introduces no new features but kills one little bug. Consider this a service release. (PortageXS-0.02.04->PortageXS-0.02.05 transition.)
- Also clean up USE/IUSE duplicates in outputs.
- Use getEbuildName() and formatUseflags() from PortageXS-0.02.05 (see PortageXS changelog for further information)
- Made NOCOLOR work with PortageXS-0.02.05

0.032
- Fixed typo in help.
- Work around for portage bug that made useflags appear multiple times in USE/IUSE.
- Prettified output. Hope you all like it.
- Added new option: -C, --nocolor: Turn off colors
- Check for NOCOLOR variable and apply setting from make.conf. (See `man make.conf`)
  Rule: 'cmd-line option' overrides '.demergerc' overrides 'make.conf'
- demerge now also records and restores the world file.
- Handle user termination correctly when executing external programs.
- Added a note about binpkgs and useflags.

0.031
- Fixed error that some packages weren't emerged in a demerge --restore process (broken in 0.030).
- New option --dir which can be used to change the datadir demerge uses. Furthermore this can also be
  done using the new .demergerc. See `man demerge` for further information.
- -k, --usepkg now creates binpkgs of the packages before unmerging them.
- Fixed changelog.

0.030
